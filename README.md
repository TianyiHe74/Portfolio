# Portfolio site (GitHub Pages)

## Publish
1. Create a GitHub repo (public).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3. Repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` + `/ (root)`.
4. Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Edit
- Update `index.md` to change the project list.
- Edit individual project pages (`glove.md`, `postpartum_health.md`, etc.).
- Put images under `assets/<project>/` and reference them from markdown.
